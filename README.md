# FamilyTree
This is a fun little project I'm making for my friends and I, we have made up families in a Discord server, and i am writing this program to generate the family tree.
The goal of the project to be able to look up a person by either their name or nickname, and see their family. 

## ToDo
* Save Current People to a csv file
* Load CSV files into a list of people
* Generate a tree of all the family members
* Ability to search for specific people and traverse the tree
